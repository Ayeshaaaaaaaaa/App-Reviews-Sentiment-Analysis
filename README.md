The sentiment analysis of app reviews was conducted using three machine learning models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Both Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 71.67%, demonstrating their effectiveness in classifying sentiments accurately.
Naive Bayes is particularly advantageous due to its simplicity and efficiency for text data, while Logistic Regression offers robust performance with well-separated classes. <br>
